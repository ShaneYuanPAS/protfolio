    <h2>Introduction</h2>


    <p class="paragraph">This website is the third project website we need to create for web-development class. We must create this website including the information we were told to. Including the about page where I will put some information about creating this website in the about section. In the interests part, I would put some personal interest in the section, personal interests, and some personal opinion about web-development. In the education part, just introducing some courses I took before and classes I have this year. And showing the readers about the CV page about personal information, including contact.
