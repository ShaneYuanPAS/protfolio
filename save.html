            <h2>Hobby</h2>
            <p class="parahraphhome">So of my hobbies would be sleeping, riding bike, or playing badminton. But my favorite hobbies were skiing, playing golf, watching baseball, and playing League of Legends.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started skiing since I'm about 4th grade. I really enjoy skiing during winter. I mostly went to ski courts like Shiga Kogen, Hakuba, and Nozowa Onsen ski court. I'm excited about skiing every winter since I started skiing. The another hobby would be playing golf. I started gof since 2nd grade till now. And I really enjoy playing golf as my hobby, peace and nice. Also, baseball would be my favorite sport to watch nowadays. I enjoy watching MLB or CPBL. And these were my hobbies.

            <h2>Sub-courses</h2>

            <p class="parahraphhome">The sub-courses I have as a freshman this year was mostly about having the course credit such as technology class, PE credit, science credit. So I choose an PE class for one PE credit at the first year, and chemistry class for an science credit, but chemistry is the hardest class now in my classes. And web-development for the technology credit. So I'm making the website for this class.

            <h2>More about me</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I am fifteen years old this year. I have one older brother but none sister in my family. There are four members in my family. I am from from Taichung since I am born. This is my first time transferring to another school. I'm always single even now and not expecting any suprises. I don't really enjoy school days, but I just hoped the courses I took wouldn't give students too much homework. And this is my first published website and hope readers could enjoy it.
