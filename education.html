            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I'm a freshman at Pacific American School (PAS). I choose web-development for my first technology course in my high school year. My main courses this year would be HS English 1, Geometry, and HS World History. These would be my main classes for the first year of High School.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                This is my first year in high school in Pacific American School in Hsinchu county, Taiwan. I joined PAS 3 years ago. I can't really choose my courses in middle-school cause the school forced students to take main courses in English and History. In my freshman school year, except for my main courses such as HS English I, Geometry, and HS World History, I also choose some sub-courses such as PE, Chemistry, and web-development.

            <h2>Why these classes?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I choose PE might be having one sports credit at first. Students need a total of two-sport credit in school to graduate so PE would be my first choice. The second sub-course was Chemistry. This is the class I mostly hate and tired of in my year now. Bunch of homework and work to do during class. And the information was so hard. But I don't know why I would choose this class.... The last sub-course I took was web-development. I took this class because of the technology credit. But this class was a bit hard because I'm not good at coding and doing all this kind of programming. But it's way better than having chem. But these were my classes I took this year. And my explanation of why I chose these classes. And I hope I could have some good scores and classes also later on.
